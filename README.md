# LendLogic- A Social Lending Platform
A social lending platform that uses the alternate credit score system to create a profile for users, 
helping people in need of money connect with people willing to lend. 

The platform works like Yelp - Yelp helps users connect to restraurents near them, showing ratings for those restraurents. 
Similarly, the platform created helps lenders and borrowers connected, where the lenders get to see the various potential borrowers along with their credit profile.

Built this platform at Yale University Hackathon 2017.

Features: 
• Social platform for connecting borrowers and lenders
• Social lending application with reduced risk on the basis of credit reliability score for every individual.
• Alternative decentralized credit score model built by analyzing your spending and behavioral pattern. To increase users under the scope of credit rating, previously unused data points such as SMS, Emails, social media influence (Klout, Facebook, Twitter) APIs are used.
• ChatBot is also developed to get basic help and account information of the user.
